GPT-2 Playground

An interactive Streamlit app that demonstrates how the GPT-2 language model works under the hood.

ðŸ”— Live App: https://gpt-2-playground.streamlit.app/

ðŸ“¦ Model Weights: Hosted on https://huggingface.co/taanmaay/GPT-2-124M-weights

âœ¨ What You Can Do

Enter a prompt and see how GPT-2 generates text step by step.

Experiment with temperature and top-k sampling to explore different outputs.

Visualize how text is tokenized and how probabilities shift during generation.

Mask input tokens to test how context changes affect the modelâ€™s predictions.

ðŸ“Œ Highlights

Built GPT-2 architecture from scratch in PyTorch (no prebuilt APIs).

Integrated OpenAIâ€™s GPT-2 124M weights via Hugging Face Hub.

Designed an interactive UI for exploring LLM internals with Streamlit.
